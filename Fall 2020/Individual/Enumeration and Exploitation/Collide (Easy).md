# Collide (Easy)

1. What programming language is this program written in?
1. What flag will successfully validate against this program?

---
### You can search what .pyc is
- `Python` <br>
### Using ToolNB](https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html) to decompile the program  to take a look at it.
```python
import sys
arr = [
 146, 136, 252, 123, 207, 114, 151, 103, 129, 108, 40, 19, 176]
compArr = [193, 195, 165, 86, 151, 33, 220, 50, 172, 94, 28, 36, 137]
inArr = list(sys.argv[1])
for x in xrange(len(arr)):
    if not arr[x] ^ ord(inArr[x]) == compArr[x]:
        print 'Fail'
        sys.exit()

print 'Pass'
```
### The program I wrote makes a new list called 'alp' which stores all the possible characters, it then checks each character to see if it matches the compArr. If it does it adds it to the output and then prints out the output
```python
import sys
alp = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-1234567890')
arr = [146, 136, 252, 123, 207, 114, 151, 103, 129, 108, 40, 19, 176]
compArr = [193, 195, 165, 86, 151, 33, 220, 50, 172, 94, 28, 36, 137]
for y in range (13):
	for x in range(len(alp)):
		if not arr[y] ^ ord(alp[x]) == compArr[y]:
			continue
		output += alp[x]
 print (output)
```
